<h2>Initial Releases</h2>
      <p>The initial release includes detailed guides for select prefectures, cities, and towns, such as Hokkaido, Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, and Okinawa.</p>
      <p>As the directory continues to expand, travelers can expect comprehensive coverage of all prefectures, ensuring access to accurate and practical information for an enriching exploration of Japan.
	<br><br>The borders of Japan's prefectures have their origins in the Meiji Restoration, a period of rapid modernization and political reform that began in 1868. Before this time, during the Edo era (1603-1868), Japan was divided into feudal domains controlled by lords (daimyo) under the rule of the Tokugawa shogunate. The Meiji government replaced these domains with a modern, centralized nation, initially creating 305 prefectures. These were later consolidated into the 47 prefectures we have today. The borders were drawn considering historical boundaries, geographical features, and cultural factors to ensure effective governance.</p><br>
